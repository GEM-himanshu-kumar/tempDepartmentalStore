# Departmental Store Management System

Welcome to our Departmental Store Management System! This repository houses the codebase for a robust system designed to efficiently manage customers, products, orders, backorders, and discounts. Below, you'll find an overview of the system's features and guidelines for using it effectively.

## Features

1. **Customer Management**: Easily create, update, and manage customer records within the system.
2. **Product Management**: Seamlessly handle products, including creation, updating, and deletion. The system keeps track of product quantities and backorders.
3. **Discount Management**: Create and apply discounts to orders as needed, enhancing flexibility in pricing strategies.
4. **Order Management**: Efficiently manage orders, including creation, updates, and deletion. The system dynamically handles order fulfillment and backorders based on product availability.
5. **Backorder Handling**: If an order exceeds available stock, the system automatically generates a backorder, ensuring no sales are lost due to inventory issues and sends notification once the product is available.
6. **Order Updates**: Easily modify existing orders with checks for quantity changes, ensuring accurate updates to product quantities and backorder status.
7. **Order Deletion**: Deleting an order triggers an increase in product quantity and resolves any associated backorders.

## Guidelines

- **Order Creation**: Prior to order creation, the system validates product availability and stock. If products are available, the order is processed; otherwise, a backorder is generated.
- **Order Deletion**: Deleting an order triggers an increase in product quantity and resolves associated backorders if products become available.
- **Product Updates**: Product quantities can be adjusted, with the system automatically checking for backorder fulfillment if quantities are increased.
- **Exception Handling**: The system throws exceptions for invalid operations, such as attempting to update a product quantity without changes or reducing a product quantity without sufficient availability.
- **Notifications**: Notifications are sent to relevant parties when backorders are resolved or when orders are updated (not implemented working code to send notification).

## Working

### Order Management:

- If the ordered quantity exceeds the quantity left in stock, a backorder is created.
- Deleting an order results in an increase in product quantity.
- When updating an order:
    - If the product quantity remains unchanged, an exception is thrown to indicate that the quantity has not been updated.
    - If the product quantity is increased:
        - Update the product quantity.
        - Check if any backorders can be fulfilled:
            - If fulfilled, resolve the backorder and send a notification.
    - If the product quantity is decreased:
        - Update the product quantity.
        - Check if more product is available to fulfill the order:
            - If yes, update the product and order (update the amount as well).
            - If not, an exception is thrown to indicate that the quantity has not been updated because updated product quantity is more then the quantity left in the stock.
- Only the product quantity can be updated for an order; nothing else.

### Order Creation:

- Check product availability and stock.
    - If available, decrease the product quantity in product repository, calculate the amount, apply any discounts, and save the order.
    - If not available, create a backorder.

### Order Deletion:

- Deleting an order means increasing the product quantity.
    - Update the product quantity.
    - Check if any backorders can be fulfilled:
        - If fulfilled, resolve the backorder and send a notification.

### Update Product:

- Product quantity may increase or decrease.
    - If decreased, simply update the product.
    - If increased:
        - Update the product quantity.
        - Check if any backorders can be fulfilled:
            - If fulfilled, resolve the backorder and send a notification.
